    "3405": "we were very close to the magic fountains , the tourist bus stops and crue coberta shopping street .",
    "3406": "the only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an asian restaurant with no english spoken and had a great buffet meal , better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate , 50m from the hotel .",
