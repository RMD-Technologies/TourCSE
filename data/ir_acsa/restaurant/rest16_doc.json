    "224": "management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.",
    "225": "many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.",

    "254": "oh i forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.",
    "255": "my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and i guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.",
    "256": "in other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.",
    "257": "if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park.",
    "258": "its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.",

    "267": "as part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;",
    "268": "any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.",
    "269": "when we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.",
    "270": "after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.",
    "271": "a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been \"blown off\" would be an understatement.",
    "272": "the manager continually interrupted with \"is there anything else i can do for you?\", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.",
    "273": "she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.",
    "274": "in short, schooner or later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.",
    "275": "you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.",

    "289": "when i walked in, i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.",
    "290": "i picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.",
    "291": "the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.",
    "292": "the steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.",
    "293": "though, one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak.",
    "294": "my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ?msg? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant.",
    "295": "they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.",

    "304": "the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic.",
    "305": "i've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.",

    "360": "to start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.",
    "361": "they serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.",
    "362": "i should have just asked for the check when i saw that; but their menu was so unique that i continued.",

    "389": "i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.",
    "390": "the food is very average...the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.",
    "391": "the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree.",
    "392": "i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).",
    "393": "their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for purple haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!",

    "399": "however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",
    "400": "i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.",
    "401": "i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.",
    "402": "food is great.",
    "403": "service is top notch.",
    "404": "i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.",
    "405": "it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.",
    "406": "the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.",
    "407": "the rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.",
    "408": "we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.",
    "409": "the food was well prepared and the service impecable.",
    "410": "quite simply it's like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.",

    "418": "also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.",
    "419": "if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.",

    "421": "the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it.",
    "422": "once you step into cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path parisian bistro.",
    "423": "this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain parisian flair.",
    "424": "the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!",
    "425": "it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.",
    "426": "the pizza is overpriced and soggy.",

    "460": "it's all about the food !!",
    "461": "but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.",

    "591": "first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review.",

    "593": "slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.",
    "594": "service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.",
    "595": "for instance, plates were just dumped on the table, i was handed the wine list upside down, etc....",
    "596": "somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.",
    "597": "to be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora.",

    "1342": "my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.",

    "1373": "the service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",
    "1374": "we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!",
    "1375": "we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.",
    "1376": "they are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!",
    "1377": "great shabu shabu",
    "1378": "but for the shabu shabu, you won't find much better in ny.",
