    "1574": "got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.",
    "1575": "scalina fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.",
    "1576": "i recommend the thai popcorn :)",
    "1577": "everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.",
    "1578": "as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.",
    "1579": "the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.",
    "1580": "the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.",

    "1582": "ummm...the beer was cold.",
    "1583": "we had great desserts (including the best cannoli i've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.",
    "1584": "good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.",
    "1585": "we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.",
    "1586": "where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.",
    "1587": "the halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.",

    "1613": "the bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!",
    "1614": "if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.",
    "1615": "i can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.",
    "1616": "best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.",
    "1617": "go here for the drinks!",
    "1618": "butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.",
    "1619": "we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.",
    "1620": "it cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.",
    "1621": "we were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.",

    "1627": "even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.",
    "1628": "the bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.",

    "1630": "an excellent service",
    "1631": "i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must!",

    "1681": "ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.",
    "1682": "i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.",
    "1683": "they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.",
